The stomp, the crunch, the shake, the earth did quake.<br>
He moved from side to side, his body slumped.<br>
The voices would not die, repeating now.<br>
They called to him from darkness still.<br>
Inside the pain was twisted, pulsating,<br>
The voices, faces - pleading, seeking peace.<br>
He could not give what they seek, those beyond.<br>
But yet they called to him still from the night.<br>
Dispel the voices just a moment by,<br>
Consuming spirits strong and not yet aged.<br>
To swat them away, he moves out his hand.<br>
They move as puffs of smoke, ever beyond.<br>
His breath expelled into the void ahead.<br>
His body leaned to one side, shifting weight.<br>
Ever moving, the horse in disgust neighed.<br>
The last moment he would regain his seat.<br>
Each day to wait for those long gone from here,<br>
To open one's eyes each day hearing them.<br>
The burden that is memories - the gift.<br>
They remain his companions in the dark.<br>
The darkness calls and waits for a response.<br>
From darkness comes a face, a face he knows.<br>
Anyone, he pleads, but not you - away!<br>
His screams on deaf ears fall, no one is there.<br>
His screaming frightens his old companion,<br>
The horse begins to bolt through fog and night.<br>
Its rider shaken from the past at last,<br>
He tries to regain his centre - no avail.<br>

## Aroha.dev

Last night, my son and I went for a walk behind our home. It is one of the few times we are able to get out during the current self-isolation and it is joyous to walk, talk and listen to the birds. While walking, we had a conversation in which my son said that this pandemic and the resulting lock-down have given him time to consider things from a more philosophical perspective and to think more of others. I was very proud of him.

I purchased this site recently as an effort to help others. We were already in lock-down and I was thinking of the need for elearning, app development and other skills, as New Zealand and the world quickly migrate to even more elearning. I decided that I could pull together my desire to help others with my professional expertise in online training, app development, data science and a number of other areas. From this desire to help, this site was born.

## Mobile App Development, E-Learning, Data Science and More

Yes, I hope to discuss all of these things on this site! I am currently working through a mobile app to help those in self-isolation and might even post a bit about this development.

Looking forward to helping others, together!

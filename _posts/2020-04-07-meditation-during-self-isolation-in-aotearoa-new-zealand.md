<p>It has been almost two weeks since the New Zealand government required all non-essential workers, students and others to self-isolate. My son and I have been home together for these two weeks. It has been a time when we have cooked meals together, gone for evening walks and otherwise enjoyed each other&#8217;s company. I have also been able to meditate like I am generally only able to during the end of year holidays. While there is concern about what is next, there is also a centering from meditation.</p>

<p>I have made some audio files and might share a few here.</p><p>Kia kaha, whānau!</p>

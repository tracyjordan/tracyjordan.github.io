<p>I’ve always liked Kandinsky’s abstract art. It’s unabashed, passionate, complex, bold, intelligent, empathic, engaging. I can stand in front of a piece and just feel and think and drink it in with my eyes. It’s a pleasureful experience that holds me captive, drawing me into the present moment to commune with the art.
Reflecting on what speaks to me with his art, I realize these are qualities my husband has and my response to Kandinsky's art is similar to my spiritual connection I have with my husband.</p>

<p>I’ve stood in front of Kandinsky’s multiple times in my life, years before meeting my husband. How could I have known, dreamt, or imagined that my future love and partner for life would be a work of art just for me to take in and experience every day?</p>

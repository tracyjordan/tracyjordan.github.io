<h2>Gerald Lee Jordan</h2>

<p>I began counselling in the 1980s and, after many years of life experience (study, travel, parenting and work), I returned to this love by beginning a Master of Counselling and volunteer telephone counsellor training in 2009.</p>

<p>Few things bring me more joy or satisfaction than helping others and I am currently expanding my assistance into newer endeavours online.</p>
